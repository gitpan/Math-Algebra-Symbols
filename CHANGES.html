<p>2004/06/02 1.17 Following further excellent suggestions from Mike Schilli
slightly improved notation for equation solving:</p>
<p><strong>eq</strong> is a synonym for <strong>-</strong></p>
<p><strong>&gt;</strong> is a synonym for <strong>solve()</strong></p>
<p>Thus:</p>
<pre>
  $x      = symbols('x');
 ($a, $b) =  @{ ($x**2 eq 5*$x+6) &gt; $x };</pre>
<pre>
  print &quot;$a,$b\n&quot;;</pre>
<pre>
 # 2,3</pre>
<p>2004/06/01 1.16 Following excellent suggestions from Mike Schilli detect
constants with decimal places and convert them to rational fractions,
thus 1.2 becomes 12/10. The rationale: using fractions avoids loss of
precision, if you only need approximate numerical results, there is no
need for symbolic manipulations.</p>
<p>2004/05/28 1.15 Minor changes to documentation.</p>
<p>2004/05/27 1.14 Admiring new CPAN Layout: diff+grep. Updated META.yml
requires/recommends to match MANIFEST.  Removed use of Hash::Util
as this seems to be causing problems with ActiveState.</p>
<p>2004/05/11 1.13 Memory Leak and <strong>exp()</strong> problems solved:</p>
<p>1. Solved a memory leak by using Scalar::Util::weaken(). This has
reduced memory consumption when running the test cases from 130M to 37M:
intermediate expressions are now being freed. I believe that this has
been the source of the erratic failures on various platforms, other than
my development system, as reported (most helpfully) by CPAN testers and
a Mac OSX user: these reported errors appear to have been related to
running out of memory.</p>
<p>2. Corrected <strong>exp(-i)*exp(-i)</strong> which was being correctly reduced to
<strong>exp(0)</strong>, but should have been reduced further to <strong>1</strong>, which was
causing the multiply out of <strong>exp(i...)</strong> in <strong>cot(x) == 1/tan(x)</strong> to fail.</p>
<p>3. Added the != operator, as this simplifies testing with the test
harness.</p>
<p>2004/04/30 1.12 Included PREREQ_PM in Makefile as a result of notes from
automated CPAN testing.</p>
<p>2004/04/24 1.08 Included test cases in manifest and renamed to .t in
line with observed practice.</p>
<p>2004/03/28 Split into three classes.  Considerable performance
improvements.  Added standard Perl Test harness.  Unfixed <code>power()</code>
so we are back to constant powers.</p>
<p>2004/03/14 Fixed <code>power()</code> so that it recognizes constant and variable
powers. Added TODO List. Finished testSM(): new requirements in TODO.</p>
<p>2004/03/13 Added change log on esteemed advice of Steffen Müller. Made
yet another attempt to stop <code>polynomialDivide()</code> from producing an
infinite series as a representation of a single term. Most of
mathematics seems to erupt from the division of one polynomial by
another.</p>
