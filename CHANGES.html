<p>2004/03/28 Split into three classes.  Considerable performance
improvements.  Added standard Perl Test harness.  Unfixed <code>power()</code>
so we aer back to constant powers.</p>
<p>2004/03/14 Fixed <code>power()</code> so that it recognizes constant and variable
powers. Added TODO List. Finished testSM(): new requirements in TODO.</p>
<p>2004/03/13 Added change log on esteemed advice of Steffen Müller. Made
yet another attempt to stop <code>polynomialDivide()</code> from producing an
infinite series as a representation of a single term. Most of
mathematics seems to erupt from the division of one polynomial by
another.</p>
