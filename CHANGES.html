<p>2004/04/24 1.13 Memory Leak and Exp problems solved:</p>
<p>1. Solved a memory leak by using Scalar::Util::weaken(). This has
reduced memory consumption when running the test cases from 130M to 37M:
intermediate expressions are now being freed. I believe that this has
been the source of the erratic failures appearing on various platforms
other than my development system, as reported (most helpfully) by CPAN
testers and an Mac OSX user, which appear to have been running out of memory.</p>
<p>2. Corrected <code>exp(-i)*exp(-i)</code> which was being correctly reduced to
exp(0), but should have been reduced further to 1, which was causing the
multiply out of <code>exp(i...)</code> in <code>cot(x)</code> == 1/tan(x) to fail erratically.</p>
<p>2004/04/24 1.12 Included PREREQ_PM in Makefile as a result of notes from
automated CPAN testing.</p>
<p>2004/04/24 1.08 Included test cases in manifest.</p>
<p>2004/03/28 Split into three classes.  Considerable performance
improvements.  Added standard Perl Test harness.  Unfixed <code>power()</code>
so we are back to constant powers.</p>
<p>2004/03/14 Fixed <code>power()</code> so that it recognizes constant and variable
powers. Added TODO List. Finished testSM(): new requirements in TODO.</p>
<p>2004/03/13 Added change log on esteemed advice of Steffen Müller. Made
yet another attempt to stop <code>polynomialDivide()</code> from producing an
infinite series as a representation of a single term. Most of
mathematics seems to erupt from the division of one polynomial by
another.</p>
