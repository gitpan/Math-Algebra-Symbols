    2004/04/24 1.08 Included test cases in manifest.

    2004/03/28 Split into three classes. Considerable performance
    improvements. Added standard Perl Test harness. Unfixed power() so we
    are back to constant powers.

    2004/03/14 Fixed power() so that it recognizes constant and variable
    powers. Added TODO List. Finished testSM(): new requirements in TODO.

    2004/03/13 Added change log on esteemed advice of Steffen Müller. Made
    yet another attempt to stop polynomialDivide() from producing an
    infinite series as a representation of a single term. Most of
    mathematics seems to erupt from the division of one polynomial by
    another.
