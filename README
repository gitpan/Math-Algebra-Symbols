Math::Algebra::Symbols
    Symbolic Algebra using Perl.

    Copyright Philip R Brenan, 2004

    This package supplies a set of functions and operators to manipulate
    Perl expressions algebraically:

     use symbols hyper=>1;

     ($n, $x, $y) = symbols(qw(n x y));

     $a = sin($x)**2 + cos($x)**2; 
     $b = (sin($n*$x)+cos($n*$x))->d->d->d->d/(sin($n*$x)+cos($n*$x));
     $c = tanh($x+$y)==(tanh($x)+tanh($y))/(1+tanh($x)*tanh($y));

     print "$a\n$b\n$c\n";

     # 1                                        
     # $n**4                                   
     # 1

    This is alpha code. It is written in pure Perl. It uses the standard
    Perl install mechanism or the ActiveState PPM Installer.

    For a standard Perl install: download Math-Algebra-Symbols-1.12.tar.gz,
    from CPAN: http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/dist/Math-Algebra-Symbols or from
    SourceForge: https://sourceforge.net/projects/algeops/, untar and:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

    If you are on Windows, use nmake, available at:

    http://download.microsoft.com/download/vc15/Patch/1.52/W95/EN-US/Nmake15
    .exe

    For an ActiveState PPM Install: download
    Math-Algebra-Symbols-XXX-PPD.tar.gz, to a local file, untar and:

      ppm3.bat
      repository add local file:://c:/downloads
      search algebra
      install

    Use the directory into which you untarred in place of
    file://c:/downloads

    I believe that we should try to capture all known Mathematics
    symbolically in Perl. Indeed, can you say that you know any Mathematics
    at all if you cannot explain it in Perl?

    Help with this project would be appreciated.
