Math::Algebra::Symbols - Symbolic Algebra using Perl.

Copyright Philip R Brenan, 2004

This package supplies a set of functions and operators to manipulate
Perl expressions algebraically:

 use symbols hyper=>1;

 ($n, $x, $y) = symbols(qw(n x y));

 $a = sin($x)**2 + cos($x)**2; 
 $b = ($x**8-1) / ($x-1);
 $c = (sin($n*$x)+cos($n*$x))->d->d->d->d/(sin($n*$x)+cos($n*$x));
 $d = tanh($x+$y)==(tanh($x)+tanh($y))/(1+tanh($x)*tanh($y));

 print "$a\n$b\n$c\n$d\n";

 # 1                                        
 # 1+$x+$x**2+$x**3+$x**4+$x**5+$x**6+$x**7
 # $n**4                                   
 # 1

This is alpha code. It is written in pure Perl. It uses the standard
Perl install mechanism. Documentation and Examples in pod at end of
module.

I believe that we should try to capture all known Mathematics
symbolically in Perl. Indeed, can you say that you know any Mathematics
at all if you cannot explain it in Perl?

Help with this project would be appreciated.
