Math::Algebra::Symbols
    Symbolic Algebra using Perl.

    Copyright Philip R Brenan, 2004

    This package supplies a set of functions and operators to manipulate
    Perl expressions algebraically:

     use Math::Algebra::Symbols hyper=>1;

     my ($n, $x, $y) = symbols(qw(n x y));

     my  $a    += ($x**8 - 1)/($x-1);
     my  $b    +=  sin($x)**2 + cos($x)**2; 
     my  $c    += (sin($n*$x) + cos($n*$x))->d->d->d->d / (sin($n*$x)+cos($n*$x));
     my  $d     =  tanh($x+$y) == (tanh($x)+tanh($y))/(1+tanh($x)*tanh($y));
     my ($e,$f) =  @{($x**2 eq 5*$x-6) > $x};

     print "$a\n$b\n$c\n$d\n$e,$f\n";

     # $x+$x**2+$x**3+$x**4+$x**5+$x**6+$x**7+1
     # 1
     # $n**4
     # 1
     # 2,3

    Following the excellent work done by Steffen Müller (CPAN Author:
    SMUELLER), I believe that we should try to capture all known Mathematics
    symbolically in Perl. Indeed, can you say that you know any Mathematics
    at all if you cannot explain it in Perl?

    Help with this project would be appreciated.
